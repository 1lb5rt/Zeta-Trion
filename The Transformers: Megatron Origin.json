  "description": "Before allegiance, rank and function - before war - a civilian will become a warrior, and warrior will become a leader. As a leader he will learn of the most powerful weapon on the planet - a weapon powerful enough to bind legions to his will - a faction named Decepticon. This landmark collection brings the would-be major players of that faction together for the first time in a seminal story for Megatron, the Decepticons and the Great War; also includes a cover gallery by artist Alex Milne and variant cover artist Marcelo Matere.",
